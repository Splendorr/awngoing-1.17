Madeleine V.-David:

bq.. "It is certain that, in nineteenth-century thought, a gap is produced following the too exclusive apology for the facts of language (begun by Herder). Paradoxically, the century of the great decipherings made a tabula rasa of the long preparation for those decipherings by parading the century's disaffection from the problem of signs.... 

Thus a gap remains to be filled, a {lt continuity} to be re-established...

One can do no better than to indicate... the Leibnizian texts which deal, often conjointly, with the facts of the Chinese and the projects for a universal writing, and the multiple positions possible for writing and for the spoken... But perhaps we do not suffer from the {lt blindness} of the nineteenth century with regard to signs. Undoubtedly the fact that there are 'alphabetic' writers also conspires strongly in hiding from us such essential aspects of the activity of writing."

bq. "We must learn to reread what has been thus confused for us."
